## Overview of the Analysis


* The purpose of the analysis is to estimate healthy and high-risk loans using a regression model.
* Using loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income percentage, number of accounts, marks against the accounts, total debt and loan status, we were able to review and predict healthy and high-risk loans.
* We were attempting to analyze the predictability of loan status.
* We processed the data, validated the data and evaluated the model.
* The supervised learning classification models we used were logistic regression and probability.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  *Accuracy - how often the model is correct. There 18759 True Positive Results and 625 True Negative Results
  *Precision - the ratio of correctly predicted True Positives to the Total Predicted Positive Observation. The Model better predicts the healthy loans with 100% vs. the high risk loans with 87%.
  *Recall - ratio of actual positives identified correctly. The Model better predicts the healthy loans with 100% vs. the high risk loans of 89%.

## Summary

Only 1 model was utilized for this evaluation. Further model evaluations may provide better predictions of high-risk loans.
